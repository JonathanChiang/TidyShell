## Overview

Collaborative project to help teams use Python and R 

## Initial Goals 

- Share Scikit learn models made in python in a python REPL (sharing the python's object sessions) Sharing that object into an R session, and see if one can make predictions based off the "serialized" python module.

- Share a basic pytorch mnist model built in python and serialized to R
*[Backlog?]*

- working proof of concept of rpy2 *[Gordon Finished]*

- document work being done in blog post and R/Python community feedback *[Assigned to Jonathan]*


## Roadmap Ideas 

* publish pre-print on arxiv

* Utilize apache arrow and parquet to serialize objects for in-memory and on-disk. This would help provide a way to bridge pandas and tidy dataframes.
