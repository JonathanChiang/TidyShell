## Overview

Collaborative project to help teams use Python and R 

## Initial Goals 

Share Scikit learn models made in python in a python REPL (sharing the python's object sessions) Sharing that object into an R session, and see if one can make predictions based off the "serialized" python module.
[Gordon Finished]

Share a basic pytorch mnist model built in python and serialized to R

## Roadmap Ideas 

* Utilize apache arrow and parquet to serialize objects for in-memory and on-disk. This would help provide a way to bridge pandas and tidy dataframes.
