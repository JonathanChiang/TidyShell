Collaborative project to help teams use Python and R 

Initial Goal: 

Share Scikit learn models made in python in a python REPL (sharing the python's object sessions) Sharing that object into an R session, and see if one can make predictions based off the "serialized" python module. 

Future Roadmap Ideas: 

Utilize apache arrow and parquet to serialize objects for in-memory and on-disk. This would help provide a way to bridge pandas and tidy dataframes.
